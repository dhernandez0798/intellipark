# Intellipark

IntelliPark is my graduation project. It's designed as a web application built to provide business owners stats and graphs about their clients.

## Client
It's built using Angular and Nebular.

## Backend
Refactored from ES6, now it's entirely build on TypeScript, using ESLint, TypeORM, Express and Passport.
